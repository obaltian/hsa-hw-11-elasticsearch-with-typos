# hsa-hw-11-elasticsearch-with-typos

Create ES index that will serve autocomplete needs with leveraging typos and errors (max 3 typos if word length is bigger than 7).

## Usage

### Prepare index

```sh
docker-compose up -d

# install poetry
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# OPTIONAL â€“ index is in repo; fill index with english words (237K)
./delete.sh && poetry run python index.py
```

### Query

This index can do autocomplete with typos, but because of the way it is implemented,
it can do autcorrection only for the last ~3 characters in query.

Also, it may possibly do autocorrection of more than 3 characters in query
due to fact that we calculate `minimum_should_match` based on query length, not result length.
So, we need to allow user to find 13-character word with 10-character query, but at the
same we may also need to find 7-character word. Maybe some kind of result postprocessing
is required here but I didn't do it in this homework.

Maybe

```sh
poetry run python query.py caterpilrin  # caterpillar with typos

```
